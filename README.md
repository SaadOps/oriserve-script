# Project Directory Setup Script

## Overview

This script automates the creation of a project directory structure and generates a specific file within designated subdirectories. The script is designed to help set up a consistent folder structure for various projects and create a placeholder file in specific folders.

## Script Details

- **Script Name:** `create_project_structure.sh`
- **Language:** Bash
- **Purpose:** 
  - To create a directory structure for a list of projects.
  - To identify and create a `test.txt` file within any `oriserve` subdirectory.

## Directory Structure

The script will create the following directory structure:

```
projects/
├── facebook/
├── google/
│   └── oriserve/
│       └── test.txt
├── meta/
│   └── oriserve/
│       └── test.txt
└── oracle/
```

### Steps Performed:

1. **Create Project Directories:**
   - The script first creates the main project directories listed in the `projects` array.
   - Subdirectories like `oriserve` are created as specified within the array.

2. **Create `test.txt` in `oriserve` Directories:**
   - The script uses the `find` command to locate all directories named `oriserve`.
   - It then creates an empty `test.txt` file within each `oriserve` directory found.

3. **Display Directory Structure:**
   - The script prints the resulting directory structure using the `tree` command for verification.

## Usage

### Prerequisites:

- **Bash Shell:** Ensure that you have a Unix-like environment with Bash installed.
- **Tree Command:** Install the `tree` command to visualize the directory structure.

### How to Run:

1. **Make the Script Executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x create_project_structure.sh
   ```

2. **Execute the Script:**
   ```bash
   ./create_project_structure.sh
   ```

3. **Verify the Output:**
   - The script will display the final directory structure.
   - Check that `test.txt` files have been created within the `oriserve` directories.

### Customization:

- **Modifying Project List:**
  - You can add or remove project directories by editing the `projects` array in the script:
    ```bash
    projects=("project1" "project2/oriserve" ...)
    ```

- **Changing the Filename:**
  - To create a different file instead of `test.txt`, modify the filename in the `touch` command:
    ```bash
    find projects -type d -name "oriserve" -exec touch {}/yourfile.txt \;
    ```
